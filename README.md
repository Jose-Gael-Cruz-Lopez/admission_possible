# (Ad)mission Possible

> The college application, demystified — and free, built for the first in their family.

A landing experience plus an interactive intake that turns a few questions
into a concrete plan — a recommended application pathway, a balanced starter
college list, and a study track — followed by a student dashboard.

## Overview

(Ad)mission Possible is a single-page app (migrated from a vanilla
multi-page site) that walks a student from a bold landing page through a
7-question intake and into a personalized plan and dashboard. The goal is to
make the application process legible for students who are navigating it
without a map.

The original vanilla implementation is preserved in git history (see the
`legacy/` directory before the migration commits).

| `/coaching`                        | Coaching             |
| `/join`                            | Join                 |
| `/router` → `/plan` → `/dashboard` | The intake flow      |

## The intake flow

`Get my plan` goes to `/router`, a 7-question intake. On the last step the
answers and the computed plan are saved to `sessionStorage` and the user is
sent to `/plan`; the plan's track toggle persists and is reflected on
`/dashboard`. Visiting `/plan` or `/dashboard` without intake redirects back
to the router. `computePlan()` maps answers to a pathway, a balanced
reach/target/likely list, and a track.

## Deployment

This is a client-routed SPA, so the host must serve `index.html` for every
path (preserving the old site's direct-URL behaviour). `vercel.json` does
this with a catch-all rewrite. On other static hosts, add the equivalent
SPA fallback (e.g. a `404.html` copy of `index.html` for GitHub Pages).

## Design notes

- **Type:** Geist Mono (display) + Inter (body).
- **Palette:** warm paper `#ECEAE4`, ink `#3A3A36`, electric `#3B33F0`.
- **Motion:** scroll-triggered reveals and rotating hairline "slashes",
  re-scanned on each route change, with an `IntersectionObserver` plus a
  visibility/timeout fallback. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Icons:** original freehand line icons, plus the supplied
  `learn-write.png` (Streamline Freehand) for the Learn & write step.
